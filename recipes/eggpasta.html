    <h3>How to cook a delicious Egg Pasta</h3>

<p>
    Boil approximately 3 cups of water with a little salt, once it breaks the boil, 
    put the noodles and let them cook for approximately 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
    Once they are done, they are strained, in the same saucepan add the 3 eggs, just as they are, 
    just as you took them out of the fridge. 
    Stir over low to moderate heat until set. Once ready, add a little fresh cheese and continue stirring 
    (already removing from the heat) until it melts with the same heat as the noodles.
    Ready! If you want to taste you can add grated cheese to make it richer.
