    <h3>How to cook a delicious stuffed pumpkin </h3>

<p>
 Mark the pumpkin around with a superficial cut lengthwise, so that when making the cut it is even.
 Cut the pumpkin in half following the lines that were marked previously.
 With a spoon discard the seeds.
 Make shallow cross cuts.
 Place the halves on an oiled plate (skin side down) and cook in the oven at 180ºC until tender.
</p>

<p>
 Once cooked, remove the pulp leaving 1 cm on the edges so that it is stable enough and maintains its shape.
 In a bowl place the pulp and step on it.
 Add the sautéed onion, ricotta, cooked corn kernels, cream cheese 50 gr, chives, nutmeg, cumin, salt, pepper, chopped chili, 
 grated cheese and mix.
</p>

<p>
 Fill the two pumpkin halves with the mixture.
 Place the fresh cheese or mozzarella on the surface.
 Cook in the oven until heated through and the cheese is melted.

 <strong> Ready to enjoy!</strong>
